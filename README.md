This paper provides a state-of-the-art assessment of the financial and policy viability of lithium-ion battery (LIB) recycling across three major regions, including the United States, Europe, and China. It synthesizes recent academic and industrial research, evaluates regional recycling infrastructures, and compares the maturity and profitability of pyrometallurgical, hydrometallurgical, and direct recycling pathways for LFP and NMC batteries.
